  It is assumed that are 40 targets within a fixed area of 16x16 units.

  Only two laser shots are allowed in this area, and the lasers are circular with a radius of 4 units.
 
  The objective is to find the positions of the centers of these two circles to achieve the maximum coverage of targets by the circles.
 
  There are 6 sets of patterns, and when the completion signal (DONE) is received, the next set of patterns will be generated.
